// FINAL PROJECT PSEUDOCODE
// calorie expenditure (GUI)

// Prompt user...
// for GENDER (Male or Female)
// for WEIGHT in LBS (Validate for numbers only)
// for HEIGHT in INCHES (Validate for numbers only)
// for AGE in years (Validate for numbers only)
// Prompt user for activity level

// Calculate user's BMR(Basal Metabolic Rate/Energy burned at rest)
	Formula:
		Men: BMR = 66 + ( 6.23 x weight in pounds ) + ( 12.7 x height in inches ) - ( 6.8 x age in years )
		
		Women: 655 + ( 4.35 x weight in pounds ) + ( 4.7 x height in inches ) - ( 4.7 x age in years )

// Calculate TDEE(Total Daily Energy Expenditure)
	Formula:
		BMR * Activity Level
			Sedentary: x 1.2
			Lightly Active: x 1.375
			Moderately Active: x 1.55
			Very Active: x 1.725
			Extra Active: x 1.9
